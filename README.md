KonseptBooks
============

This software is now licensed to you to do with as you please, under the condition that you take full responsibility.
Whatever you do, and no matter the consequences of that action, there is absolutely no way the author or anyone else
will ever be liable for anything.
You are your own person, and have your own responsibilities.

With that in mind, I hope that you will find this useful.  It'd be great that you included some sort of thanks to me if
you base your own stuff on this, but that is in no way a requirement.
You can even just search-and-replace the whole thing and just put your name on it.  Just realize that I will never ever
help you with anything for the rest of my life, because doing so makes you an asshole.

This plugin provides a way to maintain informational books for your server's users in a way where you don't have to keep
distributing new versions of the books and wonder if everyone has the new version etc. etc.
You just have them fetch a book out of the library, and whatever book item they retain will be updated automagically.

Naturally, there are permission settings and all manner of nice things expected in a modern Bukkit plugin.

Like I mentioned, this is a Bukkit plug-in, so huge shout-out to [the Bukkit project](http://bukkit.org) for making such
a very pluggable Minecraft server.  I might not always agree with the policies of the Bukkit Staff, but that doesn't
stop me from supporting the excellent software.

Thanks guys.

If you don't know what Bukkit is, or why you should be getting plugins for it, then I'm not the one to explain it.
[The relevant wiki](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Main_Page) does it so much better.
